# Process modeller

A web based modeler is included based on http://bpmn.io , models definitions are saved at your server
![Modeller](./docs/model-demo.gif)


# Process Execution

bpmn-server provides an bpmnEngine to execute your workflow definition supporting most of BPMN 2.0 elements

# Process Server

provides an environment to presist execution Instances while running and communicate with your application.

Applications can monitor and communicate to Instances whether they are running or offline, allowing user interface to query and process Workflow steps

# Data Queries 

Since instances are saved in MongoDB you can easily query your instances (running or completed)

# Sample Web App

Included is a sample web application (running Node.js and Express.js) to allow you to visualize your workflow 

# Installation

This package requires Node.js and an access to MongoDB ()
if you don't have MongoDB already installed you can [create a free cloud account here](http://bit.ly/cyd-atlas)

```javascript
$ mkdir myBPMN

$ cd myBPMN

$ npm install bpmn-server

$ cp node_modules/bpmn-server/WebApp/. ./  -r

Windows: 
xcopy /e /i /s /y node_modules\bpmn-server\WebApp\*.* .
```
Edit configuration file to have MongoDB point to your server or free cloud account
```javascript
node app
```

# Demo

a full demo site is available @ http://bpmn.omniworkflow.com

# Example

```javascript
    const server = new BPMNServer(configuration, logger);

    let response = await server.execute('Buy Used Car');

    // let us get the items
    const items = response.items.filter(item => {
        return (item.status == 'wait');
    });

    items.forEach(item => {
        console.log(`  waiting for <${item.name}> -<${item.elementId}> id: <${item.id}> `);
    });

    console.log('Invoking Buy');

    response = await server.invoke({instanceId: response.execution.id, elementId: 'task_Buy' },
        { model: 'Thunderbird', needsRepairs: false, needsCleaning: false });

    console.log("Ready to drive");

    response = await server.invoke({ instanceId: response.execution.id, elementId: 'task_Drive' });

    console.log(`that is it!, process is now complete status=<${response.execution.status}>`)

```
